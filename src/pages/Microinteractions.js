    <h2>Work process</h2>
    <h3>This is the first time that I've joined a team of designers that was bigger than two people. Working in a team brings a lot of new challenges, such as consistency across the team, design critiques, etc. XebiaLabs helped me grow by focusing on the problem. They helped me think more openly and push analyzing the problem approach.</h3>
    
    <h4>1. Task modal redesign</h4>
    <p>For the redesigning of the task modal for XL Release, we first organised card sorting exercise to come up with the same base common ground. The exercise was lead by my co-worker UX Researcher. (My co-worker, the UX Researcher, led the exercise.)</p>

    <h4>2. Step 2 teamwork workshop</h4>
    <p>Together with the team, we organised a workshop to come up with assumptions and some quick sketches.</p>

    <h4>3. Current design</h4>
    <p>Since the preliminary investigation of the current design of a task modal created a lot of confusion with users, we documented all pain points that the user has, analysed them, and proposed a new solution. After that, we user-tested it again with correct user roles for this feature.</p>

    <h4>4. New design task modal</h4>
    <p>Task modal driven by design-thinking got great feedback from many of our customers. We gave them more space to operate with tasks, which were, at the same time, easier to understand, and see most important things in order to finish their job faster and easier.

    <h4>1. Redesigning Folder navigation</h4>
    <p>The end result was that the folder navigation is not scalable. Analyzing this problem even further, in order to solve it, it was obvious that there was a need for a good and scalable foundation.</p>
    <div id="Images"><img src={require('../images/XebiaLabsFolderNavigation.png')}/></div>
    <p>By analysing folder navigation, an even bigger problem emerged. The navigation of the tool needed changes to become more understandable and easier to navigate. By having in mind that the company is an enterprise, I am not eligible to share screens.</p>

    <h4>1. Redesigning XebiaLabs Documentation site</h4>
    <p>XebiaLabs documentation website was not scalable and not user friendly. Analyzing this problem even further, in order to solve it, it was obvious that we need a good and scalable foundation for new documentation website. <a href="https://legacydocs.xebialabs.com/" target="_blank">Take a look at old documentation website.</a></p>
    <div id="Images"><img src={require('../images/XebiaLabsDocumentationOld.png')}/></div>
    <p>Based on our user research, we determined the main pain points of the documentation site. This helped us make important decisions around organizing the content and making scalable, easy-to-use layouts for the new site.</p>
    <p>We discovered that most users were using the search bar instead of the navigation system to find content, so we put a lot of effort into making the site easier to navigate. We added an easier way to find and interact with the most popular topics and broke down each main content area into categories and tiles.</p>
    <h4>Navigating the Content</h4>
    <p>We completely redesigned the site navigation and display categories and related topics on tiles. This helps remove the userâ€™s cognitive load by grouping information logically, allowing them to drill down to the content they need. <a href="https://docs.xebialabs.com/#get-started" target="_blank">Visit new documentation web-site.</a></p>
